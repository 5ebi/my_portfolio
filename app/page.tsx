          I’m a frontend developer with a strong focus on clean UI, usability,
          and modern web technologies. I enjoy turning complex ideas into
          simple, intuitive digital experiences. I work mainly with React,
          Next.js, and TypeScript, and I like understanding things deeply rather
          than just making them work. Curious, reliable, and driven to improve
          with every project.
